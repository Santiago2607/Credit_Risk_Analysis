# Credit_Risk_Analysis


## Overview of the project

The purpose of this project is to help a fast-lending company use Machine Learning strategies such as resampling and boosting so they can predict if there is a credit risk before closing any contract with clients. In addition, we will use Machine Learning for the long-term solution by creating algorithms that let us know if the person can still be a good client in the future or if it can become a risk for the company. 

## Results

After some programming and algorithms, we were able to gather the following results:

1) The Naive Random Oversampling method has:

+ A balanced accuracy score of 0.63669.
+ A high risk precision score of 0.01 and a recall score of 0.62.
+ A low risk precision score of 1.00 and a recall score of 0.65.
