# Credit_Risk_Analysis


## Overview of the project

The purpose of this project is to help a fast-lending company use Machine Learning strategies such as resampling and boosting so they can predict if there is a credit risk before closing any contract with clients. In addition, we will use Machine Learning for the long-term solution by creating algorithms that let us know if the person can still be a good client in the future or if it can become a risk for the company.
